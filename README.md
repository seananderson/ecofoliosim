R package for community population dynamics portfolio simulation.

I am using this package to write a paper that explores the challenges with applying portfolio optimization to community population dynamics.

If you have a C++ compiler installed, you can install the package with:

```S
# install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("seananderson/ecofoliosim")
```
